*I found it hard for me to download the file I wanted in the beginning. It took me about 5 minutes to download "readme.md". Then I read the guide on GitHub: Mastering Markdown and found it very helpful learning Markdown. I think everyone should download that guide and have it for future assignments when you forget how to write markdowns. In this guide I really like the examples given, which include Texts, Images, Lists, Header & Quotes, etc., everything you need to know to complete this assignment.*
